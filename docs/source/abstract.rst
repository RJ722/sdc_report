    \section{Abstract}

    The recent hike in the availability of cheap sensing technologies and
    powerful mobile computing machinery has fueled the development of fully
    autonomous vehicles, thus transforming the transportation industry towards a
    more safe and accessible environment.

    The motivation of this project is to create a modular black-box system,
    complete with a sensory and controller array targeted for fully autotomizing
    any e-rickshaw, especially in an Indian road setting. The current phase of
    the project, i.e. Phase-1 focused on gathering as much information as
    possible from imagery of the scenario - whether that be detecting the lane
    boundaries of the road, other vehicle, distance estimation, traffic signal
    detection, static/moving obstacle mapping. In this report, we start with a
    brief timeline about the history of development of self-driving-cars since
    the early grand DARPA challenge, thereafter discussing, in detail, the
    various techniques we employed for extracting this information. We also note
    on how we can further utilize each such piece of information.

    The later part of this report presents a review on the various ethical and
    moral issues which arise with the advent of self-driving cars. Finally, we
    conclude with a discussion on the future work, towards the completion of the
    Phase-2 of the project.
